Five more members of the Viper Militia pleaded guilty Tuesday to federal weapons and explosives charges , although one of the pleas came with some anxious moments .Dean Carl Pleasant , a former doughnutmaker and candidate for the Legislature , decided not to accept a plea agreement from federal prosecutors on two counts of conspiracy to instruct in the use of and making of explosive devices and one count of unlawful possession of a machine gun .Pleasant , 27 , of Peoria , was looking at 57 to 71 months in jail had he accepted the plea but could be facing additional time of up to two more years behind bars when he is sentenced with the other four defendants March 3 , said his attorney , Jess Lorona ." There 's concern , and that concern was expressed to Mr. Pleasant , " Lorona said , adding that Pleasant 's parents also consulted with him about the decision ." But he felt the plea agreement would not benefit him anyway and that he 'd be better off before the judge without those guidelines . "The other four defendants who entered pleas Tuesday , however , were more than happy to take the deal that the federal prosecutors offered .The pleas were made before U.S. District Judge Earl Carroll throughout the day .Finis Howard " Rick " Walker , 42 , of Glendale , would serve 70 to 87 months for the two conspiracy counts and single count of possessing unregistered destructive devices .The conviction of David Wayne Belliveau , 28 , of Glendale , on the two conspiracy counts and one of possession of a machine gun will bring 57 to 71 months of incarceration .Terms of the plea agreement call for 27-year-old Ellen Adella Belliveau , David Belliveau 's wife , to receive 37 to 46 months on the two conspiracy counts .Donna Star Williams , 44 , of Phoenix pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to make destructive devices , and federal prosecutors agreed to a minimum one-year sentence for her .Five other members of the Viper Militia , who received national attention last summer after federal officials accused them of formulating plans to blow up federal buildings in Phoenix , entered plea agreements earlier .The other two Viper defendants in the case , Charles Knight III and Christopher Floyd , are scheduled to go to trial Jan. 23 .Prosecutors had demanded that eight of the 12 defendants sign the plea agreements or each would have stood trial .But the plea agreements had nothing to do with the initial furor created by the government over a videotape that the Vipers purportedly made of government buildings to mark them for future attack .The Viper group never was indicted for planning to bomb the buildings .Marty Lieberman , Ellen Belliveau 's attorney , said her plea was " nowhere near what she was accused of by  U.S. Attorney  Janet Napolitano and  Attorney General  Janet Reno . "The dozen members of the Vipers were arrested July 1 after the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms infiltrated the group and monitored its activities for about six months .During that time , the group detonated explosives in remote areas outside Payson and Wickenburg .During the investigation , government agents also came across the videotape of numerous buildings , including the federal courthouse in Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department .Pleasant told Carroll on Tuesday that he provided the narration on the tape and that it was later shown to other members of the militia group ." My intent was to get a reading from the individual members as to the tape 's worth , " Pleasant said without elaboration .
