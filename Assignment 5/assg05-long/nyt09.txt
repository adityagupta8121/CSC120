Heavy fog in Dallas after Monday night 's victory over the Stars prevented the Rangers from arriving at their hotel here until around 4:30 a.m. Tuesday .Another kind of fog hung over the club about 15 hours later , when the Tampa Bay Lightning scored three times on power plays in the game 's first 8 minutes 5 seconds , then went on to a 4-2 victory before 19,807 at the Ice Palace .The Rangers  20-16-5  seemed decidedly sluggish , until they found their backs firmly against the wall .Then it was too late ." It was a tough loss because we knew they 'd be ready and waiting for us , " Wayne Gretzky said ." We ended up doing the one thing we didn't want to do , and that 's get behind early . "The visitors picked up the game 's pace for a 25-minute span of the first and second periods , but fizzled badly in the third .They did not muster a third-period shot until almost 13 minutes had elapsed .Their third-period shot total : six , including a goal by right wing Brian Noonan 1:33 from the finish that suddenly threw in an element of suspense .But it ended abruptly when defenseman Roman Hamrlik scored an empty-net goal 30 seconds from the finish .The loss , the Rangers ' fifth straight to Tampa Bay , cooled off New York , which came in having won seven of its last eight games and on a 13-2-1 rampage .In all but one of those victories , Mike Richter was in goal .He is 12-0-1 since Nov. 26 _ the second-best streak of his career ; he is 10-0-1 in a memorable December .He spent Tuesday night 's game on the bench , having played the night before in a 3-2 victory over Dallas .Glenn Healy , so valuable to the Rangers last season during a stretch when Richter was nursing a groin pull , took his third straight defeat ." Fatigue was a factor for sure , " Healy said of Tuesday night 's loss ." I can think of some plays where we just weren't able to turn the game up and take the game over . "Healy , now at 2-7-3 for the season , weathered Tampa Bay 's early barrage and toughened up .He stopped the Lightning 's final 26 shots .-LRB- STORY CAN END HERE .OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS Now a little less woeful at 12-19-5 , the Lightning opened the scoring 2:52 into the game after defenseman Bruce Driver was penalized for holding Lightning right wing Paul Ysebaert .Hamrlik shot from the right point , with center Chris Gratton redirecting the puck into the net .The only question was whether Gratton was in the crease when he touched the puck .Referee Paul Devorski determined otherwise after a replay .Forty-five seconds later , the Lightning widened its cushion .Center Brian Bradley eased a cross-ice pass to the converging right wing Alex Selivanov , who slipped his 6-foot shot inside the net 's left post .As if that were not enough of a stunner , Tampa Bay struck again 4:18 later , this time after defenseman Ulf Samuelsson was whistled for roughing .Goal No. 3 looked similar to the previous score , with Selivanov threading a pass cross-ice to center John Cullen , who punched in a 5-footer .The Rangers found some offensive life 12:56 into the game , thanks to their power play .With Tampa Bay defenseman David Shaw serving an interference penalty , Driver 's shot from the blue line whizzed by several Lightning defenders to left wing Adam Graves .Graves , perched near the crease , jammed it home .Late in the period , the Rangers missed an opportunity to get back in the game when goalie Rick Tabaracci was caught out of position , but Graves ' 10-footer hit off the right post .Alert officiating kept New York from falling into a 4-1 hole early in the second period .Shaw 's close-range pass from the right side was intended for Ysebaert , but it bounced off left wing Luc Robitaille 's left skate and went into the net .Replays showed that Ysebaert 's left foot was maybe an inch into the crease when Shaw shot , thus nullifying the goal .The Rangers got off 11 shots in the period , but only Robitaille 's point-blank effort came close to finding its mark .Then came the forgettable third period .
