Richard Schwartz , the senior adviser to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the architect of the administration 's workfare program , plans to resign later this month , city officials said Tuesday .Schwartz , who also served as Giuliani 's deputy campaign manager in 1993 , declined to comment on his plans .But administration officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he would leave in a few weeks for a job in the private sector .The officials said he had not yet chosen from among several job offers he has received .As senior adviser , Schwartz , 38 , was a principal theoretician behind many of the Mayor 's plans to reorganize the workings of city government .He was best known for designing and carrying out the Work Experience Program , as the workfare program in New York City is known , which has put more than 122,000 people to work for public assistance benefits .The changes in the welfare program have drawn criticism from welfare advocates as forcing some eligible people off the rolls through an intensive screening program , which often involves interviewing friends and neighbors .But Giuliani considers the program one of his most important accomplishments , and often cites Schwartz for reducing the city 's welfare rolls by more than 200,000 people since 1994 .Schwartz has also been involved in reorganizing several agencies and departments and recent efforts to revamp the school system .
